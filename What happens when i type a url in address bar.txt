1. When you enter a URL into a web browser the browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS.

2. The browser sends a HTTP request to the server. the HTTP request will be sent using the port 40 as defuault or it will be sent through port 443 if it is HTTPS.

3. The browser will check for the domain name in caches in this respective order - Browser, Operating System, Router and finally your Internet Service Provider.

4. Once the browser gets the physical address of the server, the browser initiates the TCP connection and the server sends back a HTTP response.

5. The browser begins rendering the HTML starting from contructing the DOM tree to painting the render tree.

6. The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, css, JavaScript) and repeats steps 3-5. Each subsequent request completes a request/response cycle and is rendered in turn by the browser.

7. Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further asynchronous requests as needed.
