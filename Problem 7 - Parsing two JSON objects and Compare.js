/* Write an “assertObjectsEqual” function from scratch.
Assume that the objects in question contain only scalar values (i.e., simple values like strings or numbers). 
It is OK to use JSON.stringify(). */
Note: The examples below represent different use cases for the same test. In practice, you should never have multiple tests with the same name.

var expected = {foo: 5, bar: 6};
var actual = {foo: 5, bar: 6};

function assertObjectsEqual(actual, expected, testName){
        
    
}
